# EnergiChain Backend Stubs

This folder contains lightweight backend/demo stubs to replace the previous `simulations/` scripts.
They are intentionally minimal â€” meant to be imported by `main.js` as feature implementations.

Files included:
- `nft.js` - NFT cylinder auth stub
- `oracle.js` - Pricing oracle stub
- `ml-forecast.js` - Demand forecasting stub
- `cv-safety.js` - Computer vision safety verifier stub
- `mpesa.js` - M-Pesa payment/refund stub
- `qrcode-verifier.js` - QR verification stub

These are not production services. For full deployment, each stub should be replaced with a real backend service or serverless function.
