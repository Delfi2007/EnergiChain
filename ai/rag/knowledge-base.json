    "title": "How to Detect Gas Leaks",
    "content": "To detect an LPG gas leak: 1) Use your nose - LPG has an added smell (mercaptan) that smells like rotten eggs. 2) Listen for hissing sounds near the cylinder or connections. 3) Apply soapy water to connections - bubbles indicate a leak. 4) Never use a flame to check for leaks. If you detect a leak: turn off the cylinder valve immediately, open windows for ventilation, do not operate electrical switches, evacuate the area, and call EnergiChain support at 0700-123-456."
